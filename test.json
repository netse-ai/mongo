I am trying to set up an express js server that will be hosting a mongodb database. Everything is pretty standard: I have some routes open that will take in data from the client and then store that in the database.

Here is my query string:

`let url = "http://xxx.xxx.xx.xxx:3000/update/data=" + JSON.stringify(params);`


What I have noticed is that if `params` doesn't contain much information, it works fine. However, if `params` is contains a lot of information, then the client throws this error:

    Failed to load resource: The network connection was lost.
    Http failure response for (unknown url): 0 Unknown Error

(This same error is happening in both Safari and Chrome.)

For example, if params is as below:

    {
      "accountId": "12345678910",
      "data": [
        1, 2, 3, 4
      ]
    }

then there is no issue. However, if `params.data` is a huge array with a ton of information in it instead of just `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, then the error is thrown.

Also, my express server never even seems to receive the request. No logs; nothing. What I would expect to happen is just a normal response and result, however it seems like the client is just giving up on sending something large. Perhaps it has something to do with sending it as a big string?
